# Data Science on Heart Disease Dataset using ChatGPT

Welcome to the repository for **Assignment 1**, where I applied data science techniques on the **Heart Disease** dataset using ChatGPT's code interpreter. This project showcases a step-by-step approach to performing data science tasks using the guidance and code provided by ChatGPT.

## Project Overview

This assignment involved the following key tasks:
- **Dataset Selection**: A popular **Heart Disease** dataset from Kaggle was chosen for analysis.
- **ChatGPT as Data Science Assistant**: I used ChatGPT's code interpreter to guide me through various stages of data science, from data preprocessing to model building and evaluation.
- **Report Generation**: A transcript of my interaction with ChatGPT was exported, and a summary of key insights was published in a [Medium article](https://medium.com/@praful.john2409/predicting-heart-disease-a-data-science-journey-using-crisp-dm-0996d0c96fec).
- **Documentation**: The responses from ChatGPT were organized into a formal document and included in the project repository.

## Steps Performed

### 1. Data Science Workflow
The workflow included:
- **Data Collection**: Uploading the dataset and understanding its structure.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the data using descriptive statistics and visualizations to uncover insights.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing features.
- **Modeling**: Building a machine learning model (or deep learning, if applicable) to predict heart disease.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using various metrics to assess the model's performance.
- **Insights and Conclusion**: Discussing the results and potential next steps.

### 2. ChatGPT Interaction
The entire process was conducted with the help of ChatGPT's code interpreter. The full chat transcript, detailing all questions asked and code snippets provided by ChatGPT, is available in the repository.

### 3. Medium Article
A Medium article summarizing the key findings and insights from this project is available [here](https://medium.com/@praful.john2409/predicting-heart-disease-a-data-science-journey-using-crisp-dm-0996d0c96fec). This article highlights the use of AI to assist in the data science process.

### 4. Report and Screenshots
Using the **SaveGPT** extension, I exported the entire conversation with ChatGPT to a PDF file, which can be found in the `reports/` folder. Screenshots of important outputs and visualizations were taken using a screenshot extension and incorporated into the Medium article and final report.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how ChatGPT can serve as a powerful assistant for performing data science tasks, offering code suggestions, and guiding the entire process from start to finish. The heart disease dataset provided valuable insights into how machine learning models can predict health outcomes based on patient data.
